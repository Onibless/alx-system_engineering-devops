Outage Postmortem: Web Stack Debugging Project
Issue Summary:
Duration:
Start Time: November 1, 2023, 14:30 UTC
End Time: November 1, 2023, 17:45 UTC
Impact:
The outage affected the core authentication service, causing a 30% degradation in user login and registration processes. Users experienced slow response times and intermittent failures during this period.
Root Cause:
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfigured load balancer, leading to uneven distribution of traffic across authentication servers.
Timeline:
14:30 UTC:
The issue was detected through increased error rates in the authentication service, flagged by our monitoring system.
14:35 UTC:
The DevOps team was alerted and began investigating the issue. Initial assumption pointed towards a potential database overload.
15:00 UTC:
Database load was within normal thresholds, ruling out the initial assumption. Attention shifted to the network layer, suspecting potential DDoS attacks.
15:30 UTC:
Further investigation revealed no signs of DDoS. The misconfiguration in the load balancer was identified as a potential culprit and became the primary focus.
16:00 UTC:
The misconfigured load balancer was pinpointed as the root cause. Attempts were made to rectify the configuration, but a rollback to the previous configuration failed, exacerbating the issue.
17:00 UTC:
The incident was escalated to the senior engineering team. A decision was made to temporarily redirect traffic directly to one of the authentication servers to restore service while investigating the load balancer issue.
17:45 UTC:
The load balancer misconfiguration was successfully fixed, and traffic was gradually restored through the load balancer. Normal service was resumed.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause:
The misconfigured load balancer was directing a disproportionate amount of traffic to one server, causing performance degradation.
Resolution:
The load balancer configuration was corrected, ensuring even distribution of traffic across all authentication servers. Additionally, a thorough review of the rollback process was conducted to prevent similar issues in the future.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Conduct a comprehensive audit of load balancer configurations to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations.
Enhance monitoring alerts to provide more granular details on load balancer performance.
Develop and document rollback procedures for critical infrastructure components to minimize downtime.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Implement regular load balancer configuration reviews and audits in the deployment pipeline.
Enhance automated testing to simulate and identify potential load balancer misconfigurations during the release process.
Conduct a post-incident review to analyze communication and coordination gaps during the outage.
Establish a communication plan for informing users about service disruptions and resolutions.
By addressing these tasks, we aim to fortify our infrastructure against similar issues, ensuring a more resilient and responsive web stack for our users.
